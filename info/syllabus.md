# Course Description

In Physical Chemistry 322, we will discuss the physical basis that underlies chemical reactivity. This includes both the extent to which reactions go to completion (Thermodynamics) and the speed at which they do so (Kinetics). The other main topic of the course, Statistical Mechanics, will demonstrate that macroscopic, thermodynamic properties result from the underlying microscopic properties of the atomic nature of matter.

Prerequisites: Chem 190, Math 116, and one of Physics 105, 195, or 205

Recommended: Chem 321

Ludwig Boltzmann, who spent much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906, by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on the work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics. Perhaps it will be wise to approach the subject cautiously.

# Course Structure

In a traditional college course, you attend lecture to listen to the professor talk about the material for an hour, and work on problem–solving on your own outside of class time. The thing is, problem solving is often the more challenging part of the learning process, and this leaves you to do the harder part on your own. A more effective use of time would be for you to engage with the lecture material before class, so that together we can spend class time working on problem–solving.

In this course, we will be flipping the classroom. The course content will be delivered through videos and notes outside of class, and in–class time will focus on applying concepts and solving problems collaboratively.

# Grading Scheme

There are two possible grading schemes for the course, the higher of the two will be used for your grade. Regardless of which grading scheme is used, you must have a passing exam average (60%) in order to pass the class.

### Scheme 1: Exam + HW + Quiz

| Assessment         | Percentage % |
|------------------|--------------|
| Pre-Class Quizzes | 10 %         |
| Homework          | 15 %         |
| 4 Exams           | 75 %         |
| **Total**         | 100 %        |

### Scheme 2: Exam Only

| Assessment | Percentage % |
|------------|--------------|
| 4 Exams    | 100 %        |
| **Total**  | 100 %        |

## Pre-Class Quizzes

Before each class, you should watch the lecture recording posted on Blackboard. Questions about the lecture material should be posted to the discussion board. There will be a short 2 question quiz about the lecture material, due when class begins at 9 am.

There are 40 total pre-class lectures and quizzes, each worth 2 points. At the end of the semester, the lowest 8 grades will be dropped. There is no making up pre-class quizzes.

## Homework

Each activity worksheet will include an extra problem for you to work on outside of class. You are welcome to work with other students on these problems, but you may not directly copy another student’s solution. Homework assignments are collected weekly, submitted to Gradescope by Friday by 9am. Each problem is graded out of 3 points, 1 point for effort and a reasonable attempt at solving, 2 points for correctness.

The primary purpose of homework is to help you learn the course material. Graded homework is returned by Monday, and if you did not earn full credit you may revise your work using the answer key and asking for help in office hours. Corrections are due the following Friday by 9am, also submitted to Gradescope. However, only on time homework with a reasonable effort is eligible for corrections.

Late homework is accepted up to 6 days past the deadline, with a penalty of 1 point per day, after which no late submissions are allowed. Late submissions are still be graded (after the late penalty is applied), but they are not eligible for corrections. To ensure fairness for all students, I cannot provide assistance on assignments past their deadline.

## Exams

| Exam   | Date and Time                  |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| Exam 1 | Thursday, February 20th @ 6–10 pm |
| Exam 2 | Thursday, March 13th @ 6–10 pm   |
| Exam 3 | Thursday, April 24th @ 6–10 pm   |
| Exam 4 | Sunday, May 17th @ 9 am–1 pm     |

**Note: You must have a passing exam average in order to pass the class.**

### Allowed Materials
All exams are open note, you may bring to bring a 2 page (front and back) “cheat sheet”. This can consist of your own notes, copies of my notes, your homework/activity worksheets, answer keys posted to Blackboard and textbook excerpts.

The “cheat sheet” must be a physical, printed or handwritten, document. It will be collected at the end of the exam and returned once exams are graded. Unauthorized material on the “cheat sheet” is considered an academic integrity violation.

You may also bring a scientific or graphing calculator to the exam. All other electronic devices, including smartphones, smartwatches and smart glasses are prohibited. Possession of electronics during the exam is considered an academic integrity violation.

You are required to present your physical Hamilton College ID at the exam. Students without their ID will be told to return when they have their ID.

## Exam Conflicts
All exam conflicts must be reported by the Jan 28, 5pm by filling out the exam conflict form. If you do not report a conflict, you are expected to take the exam at the scheduled time. Conflicts may require documentation to be submitted. For approved conflicts, alternative exam times will generally be scheduled within 24 hours of the original exam time.

If the conflict is conditional (for example qualifying for an athletic competition or pending conference acceptance), you are still required to submit an exam conflict form. You must also provide a date by which you will know whether the conflict is confirmed or not.

**Typically Approved Conflicts**
- Another exam at same time
- College approved event or travel (athletic competition, academic conferences etc)
- Mandatory practice for athletics, choir or orchestra

**Not Approved**
- Personal travel
- Work shift
- Club sports / club events
- Optional team events or practice

If you experience a last minute emergency, for example illness or family emergency, that prevents you from taking the test on that day, you are required to notify me by noon of the exam day. Makeup exams for emergencies are given at my discretion and require documentation. Makeup exams may also be different than the original exam.
